            Spotify has millions of songs but only few of them are truly successful.
            Is it all marketing and luck or does the sound of a song make a difference? In this project we explore the sound
            signature of around 26'000 songs on spotify to answer this question.

st.markdown("""
            The popularity score on spotify is a score given to every song and even artists to define their
            popularity compared to others. It mainly reflects how often a song gets streamed and how recent those
            streams are.

st.markdown("""
            Traditionally, a hit song is one that achieves widespread popularity. Often reaching the top of music charts, 
            going viral on social media, or dominating radio and streaming platforms.

st.markdown(f"""
            For this analysis, we define a hit song as one that falls in the **top 5% of popularity scores** in our dataset.

st.markdown("""
            A lot of people enjoy going to concerts or clubs to dance and feel the energy of music.

st.markdown("""
            Contrary to expectations, hit songs are not significantly more danceable or energetic than the general pool.
            
            The spread of hit songs is about the same as the normal spread of songs and there
            are no obvious clusters for optimal energy or danceability.

            The valence attribute describes the positiveness of a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful),

""")
st.markdown("""
            People tend to share and engage more with positive content both online and socially.
